          My passion for business started early in secondary school when I
          chose the business economics stream. After that, I decided to go to
          university and study International Management, which I had to leave
          after my dad fell sick and I had to be there for my family. After he
          got better, I restarted university and majored in International
          Management. I have found joy in marketing and all things creative. I
          had the awesome opportunity to work in London-based marketing &
          branding agency, where I had the chance to contribute to client
          projects and the marketing of the agency itself 😍 I was also the
          face behind the agency's marketing strategy which I loved ❤ I took
          over the responsibility for the podcast of the agency where I
          managed all social media accounts and communication with C-Suite
          guests 🎧

          Why not drop me a message on LinkedIn? Promise I will not bite 😬
